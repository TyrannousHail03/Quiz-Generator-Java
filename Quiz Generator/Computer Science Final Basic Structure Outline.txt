in particular is meant for the base structure to kick off the project. 

Base Structure:

  BaseFile (Class - Start and End Methods):
    Writes in base code for all Java quizzes.

  GUI Output Class?

  QuestionGen (Class):
     - Questions array, adds 1+ to NUMITEMS when user wants to add question
     - Two Versions? Single vs. Multi answers?
     - How to keep track of question order? Just write to file immediately?

  AnswerGen (Class):
     - Called directly after QuestionGen
     - Two versions? Single vs. Multi answers?

Things to look into:

    Main GUI .jar file for executing already made quizzes and a button for creating new

    For proof reading code and stuff - driver and panel classes
    
Note: Proof reading program source code should be in seperate folder, as it is essentially another project.
Also, the Main navigation GUI should also have it's own source code folder. Along with another folder for created quizzes...
Only file that should be outside of the source code folders should be the Main .jar...
